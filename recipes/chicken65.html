    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken 65 is a popular Indian spicy fried chicken dish that originated in South India, particularly in Tamil Nadu. It is known for its bold flavors, 
        crispy texture, and vibrant red color, which comes from a mix of red chili powder, yogurt, and other aromatic spices. The dish is typically made by marinating bite-sized 
        chicken pieces in a spicy blend of ginger, garlic, curry leaves, and chilies before being deep-fried to perfection. Some variations also include a tempering of green chilies 
        and curry leaves for an extra burst of flavor.</p>

    <p>Widely enjoyed as an appetizer or side dish, Chicken 65 is a favorite at Indian restaurants and street food stalls. While its exact origin is debated, it is believed
        to have been introduced at the famous Buhari Hotel in Chennai in 1965, giving it its unique name. The dish is often served with lemon wedges and onion slices, 
        making it a deliciously spicy and tangy treat loved by chicken enthusiasts.</p>
